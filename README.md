# minspanning-tree
Python 3 implementations of Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm for a min-spanning tree within a graph.


# Included
- Python file for min-spanning tree algorithm implementations.
- Queue handling module (created by me). THIS IS REQUIRED FOR THE MAINN FILE TO FUNCTION.
Both files need to be within the same directory for it to function.
